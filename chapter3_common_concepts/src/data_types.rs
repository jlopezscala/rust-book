// Rust has scalar and compound types

// SCALAR Types
/*
    - Integer
        Length	Signed	Unsigned
        8-bit	i8	u8
        16-bit	i16	u16
        32-bit	i32	u32
        64-bit	i64	u64
        128-bit	i128	u128
        arch	isize	usize

        Signed and unsigned refer if its possible to be negative.
        Signed integers allow negative signs. (+ or -)
        Unsigned are always positive, do not include the sign

        Compiling on debug mode, Rust checks for integer overflow (i.e u8 > 255)
        Compiling on release mode does not check, but wraps the values. (i.e u8 > 255 becomes
        like 256 becomes 0, 257 becomes 1)
        Relying on integer overflowâ€™s wrapping behavior is considered an error.

    - Floating-Point
        Length	Declaration
        32-bit	f32
        64-bit	f64 -> More precision

    Example:
 */


fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}

    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // remainder or MOD
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}

//  -Boolean

fn booleans() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}

    - Character
        Specified with single quotes '' different than Strings that are double quotes ""
 */

fn character() {
    let c = 'z';

// COMPOUND Types

/*
    - Tuple

        Can group together values of different type
        Have fixed length! Once declared they cannot grow or shrink
        Example:
 */

    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // Tuple values can be accessed by index
    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let one = x.2;
}

/*
    - Array

        Holds elements of the same type.
        FIXED LENGTH LIKE TUPLES

        Example:

    let a = [3; 5]; // Creates an array of 5 elements -> let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];

    let first = a[0]; // Accessing first element of the array
    let second = a[1]; // Accessing second element of the array

    let five = a[10]; // This will PANIC on runtime as the index provided is out of bounds
